There should be a section called “Study design” that has a thorough description of how the data was collected.

There is a section called “Code book” that describes each variable and its units.

The measurements will need to be described in some detail.


At minimum it should contain:

- Information about the variables (including units!) in the data set not contained in the tidy data
- Information about the summary choices you made
- Information about the experimental study design you used
