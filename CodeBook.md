# Codebook:

## "*Getting and Cleaning Data*" final project.

##### Pedro Córdova

The original data was generated by a team from "Università di Genova".

|                  |                      |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Kind of Data     | Smartphone generated |
| Unit of Analysis | Individuals          |

There was a zipped file, downloaded from: [Link to Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The assignment consisted in merge data sets, extract relevant columns, use more descriptive names in rows and columns, and create a new data set containing the means of the original values.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### File Description:

The data set contains 1 file: "*meanTidyData.csv*"

| Observations | 180 |
| Variables    | 68  |
